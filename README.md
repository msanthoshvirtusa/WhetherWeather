# WhetherWeather :partly_sunny:

The Weather Forecasting Tool is a command-line application that fetches and displays the current weather forecast for a given city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and provides information such as weather description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (can be installed with `pip install requests`)
- OpenWeatherMap API key (sign up at https://openweathermap.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code / Alternatively you can run this in Github Codespaces.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API key by signing up on their website.
4. Replace the API_KEY in .env file with your actual API key in the code.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the following command: `python main.py` or run the WhetherWeather.bat file
4. Enter the name of the city for which you want to fetch the weather forecast.
5. The tool will display the weather information including description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the specified city.

## Logging

The tool is equipped with logging to capture and track important events and errors. The logs are written to a file named `weather_forecast.log` in the same directory as the script.

## Error Handling

The tool performs error handling to handle potential issues during the execution. If an error occurs during the API request or parsing of weather data, an appropriate error message is displayed, and the tool exits with a non-zero status code.

## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model, played a significant role in developing the Weather Forecasting Tool. With its code generation capabilities and AI-powered suggestions, GitHub Copilot provided assistance in the following areas:

### API Usage

GitHub Copilot helped with generating code snippets for making API requests using the `requests` library. It provided suggestions for constructing the API URL, including the city name and API key. Copilot's suggestions helped streamline the process of integrating the OpenWeatherMap API into the tool.

### Data Parsing

When it came to parsing the weather data retrieved from the API response, GitHub Copilot offered suggestions for accessing and extracting specific information such as weather description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed from the JSON data. This made the data extraction process more efficient and reduced the time required for manual coding.

### Error Handling

GitHub Copilot also contributed to error handling by suggesting exception handling code for different scenarios. It provided suggestions for handling API errors, such as unauthorized access or invalid city names, and helped ensure that appropriate error messages were displayed to the user.

While GitHub Copilot provided valuable assistance throughout the development process, it's important to review and validate the generated code to ensure accuracy, security, and adherence to best coding practices. The tool should be used as a helpful assistant rather than a replacement for thoughtful coding and code review.

## Conclusion

GitHub Copilot greatly enhanced the development experience for the Weather Forecasting Tool by providing code suggestions and generating snippets for API usage, data parsing, and error handling. Its AI-powered assistance expedited the development process and improved overall productivity.

Please note that GitHub Copilot was used in combination with human expertise and guidance. It is essential to understand the code generated by Copilot and review it carefully to ensure it meets your project's specific requirements and standards.
